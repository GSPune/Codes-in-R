# Q.(3) Improvise the codes written in Q.(1) and Q.(2) to create a unified function for the
# measures of central tendency which will calculate different measures as per the requirement. For example, it could a function as follows.
# ct=function{lb, ub, fr, t} where lb, ub, fr are respectively the vectors of lower bounds, 
# upper bounds and the frequencies. Further, t can be 1, 2 or 3 where 1,2,3 respectively stand for mean,
# median and mode.
